# GPTCli

This is the project to get hands-on experience with AI-agents and all AI-hype around.

The first intent is to get a handy tool to get familiarity with new projects and
to navigate quickly within source, describe code, ask to refactor and/or add some things.

The whole thing should allow easy integration with my [neovim setup](https://github.com/olekhov/init.lua) (which is quite few
steps from vanilla).

Plans to support: C, C++, Rust, Python, Javascript/Typescript, Lua, POSIX sh.

This is my learning, side project, please do not expect any production-ready features.
