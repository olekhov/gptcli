# GPTCli

This is the project to get hands-on experience with AI-agents and all AI-hype around.

The first intent is to get a handy tool to get familiarity with new projects and
to navigate quickly within source, describe code, ask to refactor and/or add some things.

The whole thing should allow easy integration with my [neovim setup](https://github.com/olekhov/init.lua) (which is quite few
steps from vanilla).

Plans to support: C, C++, Rust, Python, Javascript/Typescript, Lua, POSIX sh.

This is my learning, side project, please do not expect any production-ready features.

## Building

Quite straight-forward:

```sh
$ cargo build --release
$ cp target/release/gptcli $HOME/.local/bin
```
Copy compiled binary to whatever other place where you store your bins.

## Prerequisites

`gptcli` depends on Universal Tags invokable via `ctags` binary.

This is what available on Debian sid:

```
$ ctags --version
Universal Ctags 5.9.0, Copyright (C) 2015 Universal Ctags Team
Universal Ctags is derived from Exuberant Ctags.
Exuberant Ctags 5.8, Copyright (C) 1996-2009 Darren Hiebert
  Compiled: Aug 14 2025, 14:32:33
  URL: https://ctags.io/
  Optional compiled features: +wildcards, +regex, +iconv, +option-directory, +xpath, +json, +interactive, +sandbox, +yaml, +packcc, +optscript

```

## Usage

You need to obtain OpenAI API key. Export as `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable,
or write to `.evn` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-zQPR_....
```

Navigate to your project and call

```sh
$ gptcli init
```

It will try to determine project root and save settings in `.gptcli` folder.

Next call
```sh
$ gptcli scan
$ gptcli index
```

These commands scan files in directory and build tags index.

Next, run summarize to produce facts:

```sh
$ gptcli summarize > summarize.txt
```

To generate human-readable summary of a project call:

```sh
$ gpt summarize --llm
```

Check tunable parameters:
```sh
$ gpt summarize --help
Сгенерировать секционный обзор проекта для LLM

Usage: gptcli summarize [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --llm
      --model <MODEL>              [default: gpt-4.1-mini]
      --max-output <MAX_OUTPUT>    [default: 1200]
      --system-file <SYSTEM_FILE>
      --facts <FACTS>              [default: summarize.txt]
  -h, --help                       Print help
```
